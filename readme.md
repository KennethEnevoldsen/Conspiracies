## 🔧 Installation
The required packages are available in the `requirements.txt`, However spacy-transformers should be installed from fork by KennethEnevoldsen which adds the forward pass of attention (for more see [PR](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-transformers/pull/268)).


## 🤤 Future improvements
Currently, the `lemmy` lemmatizer isn't used as it is incompatible with spacy version 3.
