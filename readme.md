## üîß Installation
The required packages are available in the `requirements.txt`, However, spacy-transformers should be installed from the fork by KennethEnevoldsen which adds the forward pass of attention (for more see [PR](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-transformers/pull/268)).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install git+https://github.com/KennethEnevoldsen/spacy-transformers
pip install pydantic==1.8.1
```


## ü§§ Future improvements
Currently, the `lemmy` lemmatizer isn't used as it is incompatible with spacy version 3.
